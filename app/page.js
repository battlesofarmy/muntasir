I love solving complex problems and breaking them down to simple tasks. I also participate in different hackathons and programming competitions.In terms of technology and framework, I am very comfortable with C++ and Javascript and have done many projects with them. I am also a good team player. Being part of teams I participated and won many programming and development related competitions.I have good leadership skills. In my college life and also in my university life I organized and volunteered in many national level events.My life motto is to be better than yesterday. I try to learn new things everyday. I try to follow a strict routine and punctual. And apart from all this tech stuff I really love traveling. I absolutely love hiking and trekking. And in my free time, I read books or watch movies. I also love to talk with strangers about no particular topic whatsoever I love.</p>
